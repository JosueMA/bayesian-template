```


```{r letter-a}

question("Say you have conducted an experiment with 2 conditions (control and treatment). Your outcome variable is a continuous variable with a range [0,100]. You have no previous studies to use for your priors, so you are going to set weakly informative priors that just tell the model which values are implausible.nWhat values do you use for the priors?",
  answer("Control mean: 50 | Control sd: 50 | Effect size mean: 0 | Effect sd: 50"),
  answer("Control mean: 50 | Control sd: 25 | Effect size mean: 0 | Effect sd: 25", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Control mean: 0 | Control sd: 50 | Effect size mean: 0 | Effect sd: 50"),
  answer("Control mean: 50 | Control sd: 25 | Effect size mean: 50 | Effect sd: 25"),
  incorrect = "Incorrect. Your control mean is the mean of the range (50). In our template, which uses a normal distribution for priors, you want your max value to be 2 sds away from the mean: (100 - 50)/2 = 25. You don't have any info about an effect so you set the effect mean = 0 and the effect sd = control sd (25).",
  allow_retry = TRUE)

```


All done! You can head back to the analysis template.
